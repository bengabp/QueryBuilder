matching_score - Needs to be converted to number because its in 0% to 100%
 - matching_score cannot be converted to integer because there isnt any way to denote its range of values


convert employee_range to max and min employees

convert- arrtibutes- to date => [ipo_round, kpi_summary.valuations, kpi_summary.values]
                                launch_month, launch_year,
                                fundings.items.month, fundings.items.year


-> add new field "date" in ipo_round -> ipo_round.date
